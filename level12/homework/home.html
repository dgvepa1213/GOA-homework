<p>The seventh generation of the BMW 3 Series range consists of the BMW G20 (sedan version) and BMW G21 (wagon version, marketed as 'Touring') compact executive cars. The G20/G21 has been in production since mid-October 2018[5] with a facelift in July 2022 and is often collectively referred to as the G20.

    The M340i, one of the first models in the range, became available for sale in the spring of 2019, with the 330e plug-in hybrid model scheduled for launch in 2020.[6] The 3 Series Gran Turismo fastback body style was discontinued for the G20 generation.[7]
    
    For this generation, BMW has begun G20 production in Mexico for various world markets including the US, replacing the Rosslyn plant in South Africa where the previous F30 generation vehicles were assembled.[8] The BMW G21 (wagon) models are exclusively assembled at the Munich plant.
    
    Development and launch
    At the end of November 2015, a final design proposal for the successor of the F30 3 Series by Alexey Kezha out of 3 total, was chosen by BMW management, as reported by Auto Bild in October 2015.[9] The new 3 Series, internally called the G20, was unveiled at the 2018 Paris Motor Show on October 2, 2018,[10] and was available for sale in March 2019.[11] In 2023, tests by the Graz University of Technology found that the plug-in hybrid version of the car emits more than three times as much carbon dioxide per kilometre as official figures claim, with 112 grammes released per kilometre travelled in the universities test as opposed to the official claim of 36 grammes released per kilometres travelled.[12]
    
    The G20 3 Series is based on the Cluster Architecture (CLAR) platform and features increased use of high-strength steel and aluminium.[13] The G20 has a MacPherson strut front suspension and multi-link rear suspension,[14] with a hydraulic damping system to better absorb impacts.[15]
    
    The G20 has a flat and covered underbody,[16] resulting in a reduced drag coefficient from 0.26 Cd to 0.23 Cd for the 320d.[17] Compared to its predecessor, the G20 is 55 kg (121 lb) lighter, 85 mm (3.3 in) longer, and 16 mm (0.6 in) wider.[18] The car retains a 50:50 weight distribution and has a 50% increase in body rigidity.[19] Boot capacity is identical to the F30, at 480 litres (17 cu ft).[20]
    
    The windshield uses double-glazed acoustic glass and the A-pillars have increased insulation.[21] The parking brake is now electronically operated and no longer uses a manual lever.[22] Engine coasting is also now available in both Eco Pro and Comfort modes,[23] and both petrol and diesel models receive engine particulate filters.[24]
    
    The 320d, 320i, 330d, 330i and M340i are available in both rear-wheel drive and all-wheel drive (xDrive) variants.[25][26] BMW India stated that it would begin deliveries of the M340i xDrive in January 2023.[27]
    
    The Touring variant (G21) was launched on 12 June 2019.
    
    The long-wheelbase variant (G28) in China was launched in April 2019 as a single trim, the 325Li, which uses the same 2.0 liter turbocharged engine making 184 hp and 300 N⋅m (221 lb⋅ft) of torque as the global 320i and is mated to a 8-speed automatic transmission as the only drivetrain offered. Later, a less expensive variant, called the 320Li, was introduced. This variant uses the same engine as the global 318i, producing 154 hp and 250 N⋅m (184 lb⋅ft) of torque and is mated with a 8-speed automatic transmission. The wheelbase was extended by 110 mm (4.3 in).[28] The right hand drive LWB variant in India, the 330Li, is scheduled for release by 2021 to replace the 3 GT. The 330Li uses a 2.0 liter turbocharged engine making 258 hp.[29] This version was subsequently released in selected Southeast Asian markets like Thailand and Malaysia, complementing the existing standard-wheelbase variants already sold there.[30][31]</p>
